# Step Component Notes

Offsets are given relative to the start of each track block (`block = track_signature_offset`). In these captures Track 1’s block begins at `0x0080`, Track 3’s at `0x0EB0`.

## Header words (`block+0x0B4–block+0x0BA`)

The 9-word mask starts at `block+0x0B4`. `block+0x0B4` carries the component ID in its high byte (step token in the low byte), `block+0x0B6` remains `0x0000` in every sample so far, and `block+0x0B8` encodes the UI configuration. `block+0x0BA` only lights up for pulse/velocity/trigger records.

### Track 3 synth capture (`unnamed 78.xy`)

`unnamed 78.xy` places the Multiply component on Track 3 (Prism synth) alongside a quantised note trig. The mask at `track3+0x0B4` mirrors the Track 1 record (IDs `0x0463`, config `0x0201`), confirming that the high byte of `block+0x0B8` holds the divide amount (`0x02` for “÷2”, `0x04` for “÷4”). The note metadata introduces extra fields ahead of the usual eight-word payload:

- `track3+0x0D0 = 0x7400` (versus `0x7500` for the ÷4 capture).
- `track3+0x0D2 = 0x147A`, `track3+0x0D6 = 0x04AE`, `track3+0x0D8 = 0x0007` tie the component back to the quantised note entry.
- The note payload that lived at `track3+0x0F0` in the note-only capture (`unnamed 65.xy`) now starts at `track3+0x0F8`.
- The tail at `track3+0x0172–0x0180` becomes `0x0D00, 0x0040, 0xFF00, 0x0000, 0x00FF, 0xFF00, 0x0000, 0x00FF`, aligning with the `0x21` linkage chunk inserted between track blocks.

Step-mask words at `track3+0x050` rotate to `[0xFF00, 0x0000, 0x00FF]` for step 9, and the `0x21 01 00 0F …` event binds the component record to the per-step note payload at `track3+0x0F8`.

## Parameter slots (`block+0x0D0` onward)

Key `u16` values touched by each component. Once the header is set, the firmware alternates guard words `0x0040/0x0100`; only the diverging entries are listed below.

| Component | File | Key words (hex) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pulse repeat (min) | `unnamed 59.xy` | `block+0x0D0=0x00FF`, `block+0x0D4=0x7700`, `block+0x0F0=0x0800` | Repeat count hides in `block+0x0D4`; `block+0x0F0` hits `0x0800`. |
| Pulse repeat (max) | `unnamed 60.xy` | `block+0x0D0=0x7900`, `block+0x0D4=0x0040`, `block+0x0F0=0x0800`, `block+0x0F2=0x7FFF` | Max/repeat random swaps the high/low bytes. |
| Hold (minimum) | `unnamed 61.xy` | `block+0x0D0=0x7600` | High byte of `block+0x0D0` tracks envelope time. |
| Trigger every 4th | `unnamed 62.xy` | `block+0x0D0=0xFF00`, `block+0x0D2=0x0000`, `block+0x0D4=0x00FF`, `block+0x0D6=0xFF00`, `block+0x0D8=0x6A00` | `block+0x0D0–0x0D6` form the condition mask; `block+0x0D8` stores the divisor (4). |
| Multiply ÷4 | `unnamed 66.xy` | `block+0x0D0=0x7500`, tail `block+0x0F0–0x0FFE = [0800,7FFF,0000,E800,5503,0155,0015,0400]` | Multiply ratio sits in the high byte of `block+0x0D0`. |
| Multiply ÷2 (note present) | `unnamed 78.xy` | `block+0x0D0=0x7400`, `block+0x0D2=0x147A`, `block+0x0D6=0x04AE`, note payload begins at `block+0x0F8` | Ratio still tracks the high byte; additional words bridge to the quantised note record. |
| Velocity → random | `unnamed 67.xy` | `0x014C=7900`, `0x014E=0040`, `0x0150=0100`, `0x016C=0800`, `0x016E=7FFF`, tail `0x0172–0x0180 = [E800,5503,0155,0015,0400,1FFF,0000,AC00]` | Reuses the pulse register pairing plus a distinct tail table. |
| Ramp up (4 steps, 3 oct) | `unnamed 68.xy` | `0x0150=7300`, tail `0x0172–0x0180 = [7FFF,0000,E800,5503,0155,0015,0400,1FFF]` | High byte `0x73` matches a 4-step span with 3-oct depth. |
| Ramp down (3 steps, 1 oct) | `unnamed 69.xy` | `0x0150=7200`, same tail as above | |
| Random span (4 steps, 1 oct) | `unnamed 70.xy` | `0x0150=7100`, same tail as above | |
| Portamento 70 % | `unnamed 71.xy` | `0x0150=7000`, same tail as above | |
| Bend (up/down) | `unnamed 72.xy` | `0x0150=6F00`, same tail as above | |
| Tonality +5th | `unnamed 73.xy` | `0x0150=6E00`, same tail as above | |
| Jump → step 13 | `unnamed 74.xy` | `0x0150=6D00`, same tail as above | |
| Parameter toggles (1–4) | `unnamed 75.xy` | `0x0150=6C00`, same tail as above | High byte reflects the enabled bitmask (first four toggles). |
| Conditional every 2nd trig | `unnamed 76.xy` | `0x0150=6B00`, same tail as above | |
| Conditional every 9th trig | `unnamed 77.xy` | `0x0150=6A00`, same tail as above | |

## Shared observations

- The nine mask words at `block+0x0B4–block+0x0C4` still OR together cleanly: the “all components” capture (`unnamed 63.xy`) equals the union of the individual component files.
- Component IDs occupy the high byte of `block+0x0B4`. The values march in a sensible order (`0x01` pulse, `0x02` hold, `0x04` multiply, `0x08` velocity, `0x10` ramp/random/conditional families, …) while the low byte carries the step token (`0x63/0x64` for step 9).
- Config word `block+0x0B8` uses its high byte for span/length data and the low byte for the secondary parameter (e.g. multiply ÷4 ⇒ `0x0401`, multiply ÷2 ⇒ `0x0201`, ramp up 4 steps & 3 oct ⇒ `0x0803`, conditional every 9th ⇒ `0x090B`).
- Most components share a tail at `block+0x0F0` consisting of `[0x0800, 0x7FFF, 0x0000, 0xE800, 0x5503, 0x0155, 0x0015, 0x0400]`; velocity random swaps in `[0xE800, 0x5503, 0x0155, 0x0015, 0x0400, 0x1FFF, 0x0000, 0xAC00]`. The synth+note capture overrides that tail with `0x0D00/0x0040/0xFF00/…` to link against the `0x21` event.
- The per-step bitmap at `block+0x050` flips the step‑9 lane to `[0xFF00, 0x0000, 0x00FF]` whenever we touch a step component, matching the "touched" state seen with previous note captures.

## Multi-step block encoding (`body[0xB1]`)

When all 16 steps have individual step components assigned (instead of a single global component), the track body contains a multi-step block starting at offset `0xB1`.

### Block structure

```
E4 [rec1] sep[0] [rec2] sep[1] ... sep[13] [rec15] sep[14] [rec16]
```

- `0xE4` header byte
- 16 step component records of variable length
- 15 separator bytes between records (no separator after the last record)

### Record formats

| UI type(s) | type_id | Size | Format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pulse | (none) | 5B | `[bm] 00 [param] 00 00` |
| Hold | 0x00 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 00 [p1] 00 00` |
| Multiply | 0x01 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 01 [p1] 00 00` |
| Velocity | 0x02 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 02 [p1] 00 00` |
| Ramp Up | 0x03 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 03 [p1] 00 00` |
| Ramp Down | 0x04 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 04 [p1] 00 00` |
| Random | 0x05 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 05 [p1] 00 00` |
| Portamento, Bend | 0x06 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 06 [p1] 00 00` |
| Tonality | 0x07 | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 07 [p1] 00 00` |
| Jump | 0x07 | 9B | `[bm] 00 00 07 [p1] [p2] 00 00 00` |
| Parameter | 0x08 | 8B | `[bm] 00 00 08 [p1] [p2] 00 00` |
| Conditional | 0x09 | 9B | `[bm] 00 00 09 [p1] [p2] 00 00 00` |
| Trigger (variant A) | 0x0a | 7B | `[bm] 00 00 0a [p1] [p2] 00` |
| Trigger (variant B) | 0x0a | 8B | `[bm] 00 00 0a [p1] [p2] 00 [p3]` |

- 14 UI types map to 11 type_ids (0x00-0x0A)
- type_id 0x06 = Portamento and Bend (both 7B)
- type_id 0x07 = Tonality (7B) and Jump (9B) — size disambiguates
- type_id 0x0a = two Trigger variants (7B and 8B)
- `[bm]` = step bitmask (positional, e.g. step 1 = 0x01, step 8 = 0x80)

### Separator formula — runs_adjusted (VERIFIED 45/45 against unnamed 118, 118b, 119)

The original hold/decrement formula matched the two extreme specimens (all-same and all-different) but was **disproven** by unnamed 118b (intermediate case). The correct formula counts **type_id runs in the suffix**:

```
base = 11 if records[0] is Pulse, else 10

For each separator sep[i] (i = 0..14):
  left  = records[i]     -- record to the LEFT of separator i
  right = records[i+1]   -- record to the RIGHT of separator i
  same  = (left.type_id == right.type_id AND left.size == right.size)

  if same:
      sep[i] = base                      (if i == 0)
             = sep[i-1]                   (if i >= 1, HOLD)
  else:
      1. Count type_id runs in suffix records[i+1..15]:
         runs = number of consecutive groups sharing the same type_id
      2. If records[i+1] starts a multi-element run
         (i.e. i+2 <= 15 AND records[i+1].type_id == records[i+2].type_id):
         adjusted = runs - 1
         else: adjusted = runs
      3. sep[i] = min(adjusted, base)             (if i == 0)
               = min(adjusted, max(0, sep[i-1]-1)) (if i >= 1)
```

**Key rules:**
- "Same" comparison uses BOTH type_id AND record size (type 0x07 Tonality 7B vs Jump 9B = different)
- "Runs" counts consecutive groups by type_id only (ignoring size) in the suffix
- The adjustment subtracts 1 when the first suffix element starts a run of 2+ identical type_ids
- Separator values are clamped to `[0, base]` and can never increase

**Worked example — unnamed 118b** (Hold x5, Random, Trigger x10):
```
types:  [H, H, H, H, H, R, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]
seps:   10 10 10 10  2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

  sep[0..3]: H=H -> HOLD at 10
  sep[4]: H!=R, suffix=[R,T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T], runs=2,
          R starts single -> adj=2, min(2, max(0,10-1))=2
  sep[5]: R!=T, suffix=[T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T], runs=1,
          T starts multi -> adj=0, min(0, max(0,2-1))=0
  sep[6..14]: T=T -> HOLD at 0
```

**Why the old formula failed:** For unnamed 118b it predicted `[10,10,10,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]` (simple decrement at each type boundary). The actual values are `[10,10,10,10,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`. The separator encodes suffix complexity, not just local transitions.

**Reference implementation:** `tools/analyze_sep_formulas.py` (`formula_runs_adjusted()`) and `tools/write_delta_tests_v4.py` (`compute_seps_formula()`).

### Delta test results (firmware validation)

Tested by creating single-byte changes from unnamed 118 (all-Hold baseline):
- **Bitmask change alone**: WORKS (firmware does not validate bitmask)
- **type_id change alone**: CRASHES (firmware validates type_id against separators)
- **Separator change alone**: CRASHES (firmware validates separator consistency)
- **Old hold/decrement formula**: CRASHES on device (predicted wrong seps for 118b pattern)
- **v4 in-place delta tests** (correct seps, no structural changes): CRASH — missing post-E4 insertion
- **v5 transplant tests** (118b's full T1 body): ALL LOAD — confirms the issue was structural, not formula

### Post-E4 structural changes (unnamed 118 vs 118b)

The E4 block itself stays 128 bytes (all records 7B). But the firmware also inserts bytes elsewhere in the T1 body when step component types change:

1. **+4 bytes after E4 block** (body ~0x131): `00 04 00 00` inserted between end of E4 block and the `FF 00 00` sentinel table. Purpose unknown — possibly a type-change counter or allocation marker.
2. **+5 bytes in sample metadata** (body ~0x675): conga/lc sample entry gains `51 3B 00 00 04` and its first metadata byte changes `0x45` -> `0x3D`. Only 1 of 24 sample entries affected.
3. **+8 bytes in each aux track** (tracks 9-16): each aux body gains 8 bytes with `40 00 00 01` entries. **Not required for loading** — v5b (T1 only) loads fine without aux changes.

Key finding: **T1 body changes alone are sufficient** (v5b). Aux track changes are firmware side-effects, not validation requirements.
