- **unnamed_80** — Added grid-entered notes on track one, pattern one: single C4 at step one, single D4 at step five, single E4 at step nine, and a stacked F4–G4–A4 chord at step thirteen
- **unnamed_85** — Track three switched to the Wavetable engine and, via step edit (no recording), a single C4 trig was placed on pattern one step nine with default velocity/gate
- **unnamed_86** — Same Wavetable setup as unnamed_85, but captured in real-time record: a live-played C4 trig lands near step eight and sustains across multiple steps
- **unnamed_87** — Live-recorded single C4 on track three (Prism) landing around step ten with a short hold (~0.7 step) while leaving all other tracks untouched
- **unnamed_91** — Track four engine changed from Pluck to Drum, single hit placed on step one (note 83, velocity 100). Uses 0x2d grid event type. No preamble 0x64 sentinel on track five (unlike note-only edits)
- **unnamed_92** — Three notes on track three with different gate lengths: step 1 (2 steps), step 5 (4 steps), step 11 (6 steps). Uses 0x21 sequential event with explicit gate encoding
- **unnamed_93** — MIDI harness capture: single C4 (note 60) on step 1 sent via MIDI to all 8 instrument tracks simultaneously. All 8 tracks activated (type 05→07). Reveals engine-dependent event types: T1(Drum)=0x25, T2(Drum)=0x21, T3(Prism)=0x21, T4(EPiano)=0x1F, T5(Dissolve)=0x21, T6(Hardsync)=0x1E, T7(Axis)=0x20, T8(Multisampler)=0x20. Gate recorded as explicit 480 ticks. Preamble 0x64 set on T2-T4, T6-T9 (T5 keeps original 0x2E — reason unknown)
- **unnamed_94** — MIDI harness capture (`selective_multi_note`): non-contiguous tracks with engine changes. T3 changed from Prism to Wavetable, T5 changed from Dissolve to Drum (empty sampler). MIDI sent via `tools/midi_harness.py` to channels 1/3/5/7: T1(ch1, Drum default) C4 step 1 + D4 step 5; T3(ch3, Wavetable) C4+E4+G4 chord step 1; T5(ch5, Drum) C4 step 1 velocity 50; T7(ch7, Axis default) E4 step 9 with 4-step hold. Tests: multi-note 0x25, MIDI chord serialization, 0x2D vs engine, velocity fidelity, non-contiguous preamble behavior, tick/gate encoding

- **unnamed_84** — Rerouted track 1 pitch bend target from synth1 to filter3 (other mod routings left at defaults)
- **unnamed_95** — MIDI harness capture (`cc_cutoff_steps`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), single C4 note on step 1 + CC32 (filter cutoff) automation at 4 steps: step 1=0, step 5=42, step 9=85, step 13=127. **CAUTION: post-roll=1 caused 2-bar playback over a 1-bar pattern — the pattern looped once, second pass may have overwritten first-pass CC automation with static final values. See unnamed 100 for corrected version.**
- **unnamed_96** — MIDI harness capture (`cc_only_no_notes`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), CC32 (filter cutoff)=127 at step 1, NO notes. Tests whether CC-only automation is recorded without a note event anchor. **CAUTION: same post-roll loop issue as unnamed 95 — CC was only at step 1 so loop impact is minimal (parameter already at final value).**
- **unnamed_97** — MIDI harness capture (`cc_multi_lane`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), single C4 note on step 1 + three different CCs all at value 64: CC12 (Param 1) at step 1, CC32 (cutoff) at step 5, CC33 (resonance) at step 9. **CAUTION: same post-roll loop issue — second pass had all 3 CCs at their final values (64), may have flattened any per-step automation.**
- **unnamed_98** — MIDI harness capture (`cc_amp_envelope`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), single C4 note on step 1 + all 4 amp envelope CCs at step 1: CC20 (attack)=100, CC21 (decay)=80, CC22 (sustain)=60, CC23 (release)=40. **CAUTION: same post-roll loop issue — all CCs at step 1 so second pass replayed with same static values, loop impact likely minimal.**
- **unnamed_99** — MIDI harness capture (`cc_volume_pan`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), single C4 note on step 1 + CC7 (volume)=100 at step 1, CC10 (pan)=0 at step 5, CC10 (pan)=127 at step 9. **CAUTION: same post-roll loop issue — second pass had volume=100 and pan=127 as static final values.**
- **unnamed_100** — MIDI harness capture (`cc_cutoff_steps` corrected): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), single C4 note on step 1 + CC32 (filter cutoff) at steps 1/5/9/13 with values 0/42/85/127. **Fixed: post-roll=0, exactly 1 bar (96 clocks, 16 steps), no pattern loop.** Definitive test of whether MIDI CCs record per-step automation
- **unnamed_101** — MIDI harness capture (`4bar_drums_bass`): First multi-bar test. T1 (ch1, Drum) 4-bar groove with kick/snare/hats (bars 1-3 steady, bar 4 snare fill) + T3 (ch3, Prism) 4-bar bass line in C minor with varied gate lengths (C2-G2). Both tracks extended to 4 bars on device before recording. 64 total note-ons, 120 BPM, post-roll=0.
- **unnamed_102** — Multi-pattern test: Track 1 has pattern 2 added. Single note trig placed on pattern 2, step 9 only (pattern 1 left empty). First capture with note data in a non-default pattern slot.
- **unnamed_103** — Multi-pattern test: Track 1 has 2 patterns with notes in both. Pattern 1: C note on step 1. Pattern 2: E note on step 9. Different pitches and steps for easy binary identification.
- **unnamed_104** — Multi-pattern sparsity test: Track 1 has 3 patterns. Pattern 1: note on step 1. Pattern 2: blank. Pattern 3: note on step 9. Tests whether empty pattern slots occupy space or are skipped.
- **unnamed_105** — Multi-track multi-pattern test: Pattern 2 added to both Track 1 and Track 3. T1 pattern 2: note trig on step 1. T3 pattern 2: note trig on step 2. Tests per-track pattern independence and how rotation works with multiple tracks having extra patterns.
- **unnamed_105b** — Follow-up to `unnamed_105`: added a single note trig on **Track 3, Pattern 1** (while keeping the existing Track 3 Pattern 2 trig). This is the first capture where a non-T1 leader pattern in a multi-track multi-pattern project contains note data.
- **unnamed_106** — MIDI harness capture (`modwheel_sweep`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), sustained C4 note (16-step gate) + modwheel (CC1) ramp from 0→127 over 16 steps. Tests whether modwheel is recorded as keyframe automation (like pitchbend in unnamed 39) or ignored (like arbitrary CCs in unnamed 95-100). Post-roll=0, 1 bar, 120 BPM.
- **unnamed_107** — MIDI harness capture (`aftertouch_sweep`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), sustained C4 note (16-step gate) + channel aftertouch (pressure) ramp from 0→127 over 16 steps. Tests whether aftertouch is recorded as keyframe automation. Post-roll=0, 1 bar, 120 BPM.
- **unnamed_108** — MIDI harness capture (`pitchbend_sweep`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), sustained C4 note (16-step gate) + pitch bend ramp from center (8192) to max (16383) over 16 steps. Complement to unnamed 39 (hand-played wobble) with known linear ramp values. Post-roll=0, 1 bar, 120 BPM.
- **unnamed_109** — MIDI harness capture (`perf_all_sweep`): Track 3 (ch 3, Prism), sustained C4 note (16-step gate) + simultaneous modwheel (CC1) 0→127 + channel aftertouch 0→127 + pitch bend center→max ramps over 16 steps. Kitchen sink test: all three performance controllers at once. Post-roll=0, 1 bar, 120 BPM.
- **p01_t4_touch_noevent** (device exported as `unnamed 111.xy`) — Fresh project. Track 4 selected, one parameter nudged (single click), no note trigs entered. Capture for "touched/active-without-event" behavior.
- **p02_t4_note_event** (device exported as `unnamed 112.xy`) — Fresh project. Track 4 selected with default preset, single note trig entered on step 1 (C4), no other edits. Capture for "note event present" control.

T1/T2 changed from Drum to synth engines before recording (Drum has no filter envelope). Notes sent alongside CCs for audible confirmation.
- **unnamed_123** — MIDI hold-record capture (`cc_map_1c`): CC32-39 sweeps on T1-T8. T1=CC32(Cutoff), T2=CC33(Reso), T3=CC34(Env), T4=CC35(KeyTrack), T5=CC36(SendExt), T6=CC37(SendTape), T7=CC38(SendFXI), T8=CC39(SendFXII). CC-only, no notes. Same project as unnamed 122 (T1/T2 on synth engines).

## Generated Writer Validation Files (`output/`)
- **mp2_v5_105b_novel_single.xy** — Script-authored multi-pattern stress file using the `105b` compatibility branch. Layout: T1 P1 blank, T1 P2 note at step 5; T3 P1 note at step 12; T3 P2 note at step 2. Device load result: **PASS**.
- **mp2_v5_105b_novel_dense.xy** — Script-authored denser variant in the same structural layout, with two notes in T1 P2 and two notes in each T3 pattern. Device load result: **PASS**.
- Both files are intentionally non-byte-identical to `unnamed_105b`/`repro_105b`, confirming the branch supports novel pattern data rather than exact-byte clones only.
- **mp2_v7_diag_h5_both_sparse.xy** — Diagnostic: both T1 and T3 carry note data in both patterns (sparse), 5-byte descriptor form. Device load result: **PASS**.
- **mp2_v7_diag_h7_both_sparse.xy** — Same sparse musical data, 7-byte descriptor form. Device load result: **PASS**.
- **mp2_v7_diag_h5_both_dense.xy** — Diagnostic: both tracks active in both patterns with denser drum+bass content (A/B variation + fill), 5-byte descriptor form. Device load result: **PASS**.
- **mp2_v7_diag_h7_both_dense.xy** — Same dense musical data, 7-byte descriptor form. Device load result: **PASS**.
- **mp2_v7_diag_t1both_dense_t3clone.xy** — Control: dense T1 A/B with T3 clone-only active. Device load result: **PASS**.
- Combined takeaway: multi-pattern generation across multiple tracks (T1+T3) is now validated on-device; prior failures were due to a Track 3 leader event offset bug, not an inherent firmware limitation on dual-track A/B pattern content.
